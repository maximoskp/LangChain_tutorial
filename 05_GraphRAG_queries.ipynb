    "# GraphRAG and Neo4j\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial looks at GraphRAG, i.e., how to provide information from a Knowledge Graph (KG) to an LLM, for making the LLM more informed about it's answers. Like RAG, GraphRAG aims to get information from a credible source of information. Unlike RAG, the information here is not provided in form of embeddings, but is rather captured from relationships between nodes within a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, GraphRAG is not applicable anywhere, since we need to make sure that there is a credible and meaningful source of information provided in the form of a graph. These graphs live in specialized databases that are indexed properly for quick retrieval of relevant information. Information from graphs are retrieved using special queries that allow fast communications with those databases and provide specific answers that can be extracted \"algebraically\" from the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is therefore necessary to have such a database and a language in place, so that we can allow the LLM to ask proper questions to the graph database and get helpful answers. *Neo4j* is such a library, that is accompanied by the *Cypher* language, which allows retrieval from the database. Working with Neo4j requires starting out a server (local server is OK) that hosts the database of graphs, connecting to the server from python and sending queries to the server for retrieving information back in python. For more information about Neo4j you can have a look here: [supplementary/Neo4j.md](./supplementary/Neo4j.md)."

Later in this tutorial we dive into a bit more detail about what `GraphCypherQAChain` does (there is also link to an additional document in this tutorial for more details).\n",

That is, we need to provide the schema to the process triggered by `GraphCypherQAChain`, so that the query does not include nodes and relationships that are not initially in the graph. To this end we need to provide the process a `cypher_prompt`, which is almost the same as the `graph_prompt` that we used to construct the graph in the first place."

To trigger this process we use the `from_llm` function, which compiles the information from the `cypher_prompt` and the `qa_prompt` and uses it on the available Neo4j `graph` that we have already available into our database (in this example, constructed from an LLM).\n",
    "\n",
    "This process involves a chain of events where the user question is translated into a cypher query, then both the question and the retrieved results from cypher are included into a QA prompt, based on which the LLM generates a final natural text answer. More information on how `GraphCypherQAChain.from_llm` works, is given in this file: [supplementary/GraphCypherQAChain.md](./supplementary/GraphCypherQAChain.md)."
