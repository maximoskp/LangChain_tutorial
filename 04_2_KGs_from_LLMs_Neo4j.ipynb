    "# Neo4j: A Practical Introduction for Knowledge Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Neo4j?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Neo4j** is a **graph database system**, not just a plotting or visualization library.\n",
    "\n",
    "It consists of three tightly integrated parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Graph database**\n",
    "  Stores data as **nodes** and **relationships**, optimized for graph traversal and querying.\n",
    "* **Query language (Cypher)**\n",
    "  A declarative language designed specifically for graphs (e.g. pattern matching).\n",
    "* **Browser-based visualization tool**\n",
    "  An interactive UI for exploring, querying, and debugging graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Neo4j differs from plotting tools (e.g. Plotly, NetworkX)\n",
    "\n",
    "| Plotting tools         | Neo4j                    |\n",
    "| ---------------------- | ------------------------ |\n",
    "| Visualization-only     | Persistent database      |\n",
    "| Static or client-side  | Server-based             |\n",
    "| No query language      | Cypher for graph queries |\n",
    "| No schema awareness    | Schema + metadata        |\n",
    "| No traversal semantics | Native graph traversal   |\n",
    "\n",
    "Neo4j is best thought of as **infrastructure**, not a plotting library.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Execution model and security\n",
    "\n",
    "* Neo4j runs as a **server process**\n",
    "* Even for local use, it:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * listens on ports\n",
    "  * manages persistent data\n",
    "  * enforces authentication\n",
    "* Therefore, a **password is required**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * this password protects the *database*, **not the operating system**\n",
    "  * it is not a one-time startup password\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical usage is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* local execution\n",
    "* SSH access\n",
    "* port forwarding for browser visualization\n",

    "\n",
    "LangChain provides a Python interface (`Neo4jGraph`) that allows:\n",

    "\n",
    "LangChain relies on **APOC** (Awesome Procedures on Cypher) to:\n",

      "Apollo 11 (July 16–24, 1969) was the fifth manned flight in the United States Apollo program and the first spaceflight to land humans on the Moon. Commander Neil Armstrong and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin \"Buzz\" Aldrin landed the Lunar Module Eagle on July 20 at 20:17 UTC, and Armstrong became the first person to step onto the surface about six hours later, at 02:56 UTC on July 21. Aldrin joined him 19 minutes afterward, and together they spent about two and a half hours exploring the site they had named Tranquility Base upon landing. They collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material before re-entering the Lunar Module. In total, they were on the Moon’s surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes before returning to the Command Module Columbia, which remained in lunar orbit, piloted by Michael Collins.\n",
      "Apollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, on July 16 at 13:32 UTC (9:32 am EDT, local time). The Apollo spacecraft consisted of three parts: the command module (CM), which housed the three astronauts and was the only part to return to Earth; the service module (SM) providing propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water to the command module; and the Lunar Module (LM), which had two stages—a descent stage with a large engine and fuel tanks for landing on the Moon, and a lighter ascent stage containing a cabin for two astronauts and a small engine to return them to lunar orbit.\n",
      "After being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V's third stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft and traveled for three days until they entered lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle and landed in the Mare Tranquillitatis on July 20. The astronauts used Eagle's ascent stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle before performing the maneuvers that propelled Columbia out of the last of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth. They returned to Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 at 16:35:35 UTC, after more than eight days in space.\n",
      "Armstrong's first step onto the lunar surface was broadcast on live television to a worldwide audience. He described it as \"one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\" Apollo 11 provided a U.S. victory in the Space Race against the Soviet Union, and fulfilled the national goal set in 1961 by President John F.

Commander Neil Armstrong and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin \"Buzz\" Aldrin landed the Lunar Module Eagle on July 20 at 20:17 UTC, and Armstrong became the first person to step onto the surface about six hours later, at 02:56 UTC on July 21. Aldrin joined him 19 minutes afterward, and together they spent about two and a half hours exploring the site they had named Tranquility Base upon landing. They collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material before re-entering the Lunar Module. In total, they were on the Moon’s surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes before returning to the Command Module Columbia, which remained in lunar orbit, piloted by Michael Collins.\\nApollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, on July 16 at 13:32 UTC (9:32 am EDT, local time). The Apollo spacecraft consisted of three parts: the command module (CM), which housed the three astronauts and was the only part to return to Earth; the service module (SM) providing propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water to the command module; and the Lunar Module (LM), which had two stages—a descent stage with a large engine and fuel tanks for landing on the Moon, and a lighter ascent stage containing a cabin for two astronauts and a small engine to return them to lunar orbit.\\nAfter being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V\\'s third stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft and traveled for three days until they entered lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle and landed in the Mare Tranquillitatis on July 20. The astronauts used Eagle\\'s ascent stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle before performing the maneuvers that propelled Columbia out of the last of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth. They returned to Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 at 16:35:35 UTC, after more than eight days in space.\\nArmstrong\\'s first step onto the lunar surface was broadcast on live television to a worldwide audience. He described it as \"one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\" Apollo 11 provided a U.S. victory in the Space Race against the Soviet Union, and fulfilled the national goal set in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy: \"before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth\".\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, the United States was engaged in the Cold War, a geopolitical rivalry with the Soviet Union. On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite, surprising the world and fueling fears about Soviet technological and military capabilities. Its success demonstrated that the USSR could potentially deliver nuclear weapons over intercontinental distances, challenging American claims of military, economic, and technological superiority. This incident sparked the Sputnik crisis and ignited the Space Race, as both superpowers sought to demonstrate superiority in spaceflight. President Dwight D. Eisenhower responded to the challenge posed by Sputnik by creating the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and initiating Project Mercury, which aimed to place a man into Earth orbit. The Soviets took the lead on April 12, 1961, when cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first person in space and the first to orbit the Earth. Nearly a month later, on May 5, 1961, Alan Shepard became the first American in space; his 15-minute flight was suborbital, not a full orbit.\\nBecause the Soviet Union had launch vehicles with higher lift capacity, President John F.
