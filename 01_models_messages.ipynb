      "2. **Melt dark chocolate + butter**:  \n",

      "3. **Make wet ingredients**:  \n",
      "   - In a large bowl, beat **sugar + 2 tsp vanilla** until pale.  \n",
      "   - Add **eggs** one at a time, beating well after each.  \n",
      "   - Mix in **melted chocolate + butter**, then **buttermilk**.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Make dry ingredients**:  \n",
      "   - In a separate bowl, sift **flour + cocoa powder + baking powder + baking soda + salt** (3x). *Sifting = air pockets = tender cake*.  \n",
      "   - *Do not skip sifting!* (This is why beginners get dense cakes).\n",

      "   *Why?* Overmixing = tough cake. Gentle folding = light crumb.\n",

      "6. **Bake**:  \n",
      "   - Pour into a greased 20cm (8-inch) round cake pan.  \n",
      "   - Bake **25–28 mins** (until a toothpick comes out clean).  \n",
      "   *Why?* 28 mins = perfect for moistness (too long = dry).\n",

      "7. **Cool**:  \n",
      "   - Let cake cool **in pan for 10 mins**, then transfer to wire rack.  \n",

It’s moist, rich, and has a classic chocolate flavor without being too heavy. Total time: ~35 minutes.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 🎂 Classic Chocolate Cake (Makes 12 cupcakes or 1 standard cake)\\n**Why this works**: Uses cocoa powder (not chocolate chips!) for a smooth, rich flavor. No fancy tools needed. *Pro tip*: The chocolate flavor is key—this recipe avoids a \"bitter\" taste by using high-quality cocoa.\\n\\n#### 📝 Ingredients\\n| **Ingredient**       | **Amount**      | **Why it matters**                                  |\\n|----------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|\\n| All-purpose flour    | 1 ½ cups        | Standard for structure (no gluten overload)         |\\n| Unsweetened cocoa powder | ¾ cup         | *Crucial!* Adds deep chocolate flavor without sugar |\\n| Granulated sugar     | 1 cup           | Sweetness balance                                 |\\n| Eggs                 | 2 large         | Moisture and structure                             |\\n| Buttermilk           | 1 cup           | Adds tenderness (use milk + 1 tsp vinegar if needed)|\\n| Vegetable oil        | ½ cup           | Moisture without greasiness                        |\\n| Baking soda          | 1 tsp           | Helps cake rise without bitterness                 |\\n| Baking powder        | 1 tsp           | For light texture                                  |\\n| Salt                 | ½ tsp           | Enhances flavor (never skip!)                      |\\n| Vanilla extract      | 2 tbsp          | Adds depth (use real vanilla, not artificial)       |\\n\\n> 💡 **Pro Tip for Chocolate Lovers**:  \\n> - **Use high-quality cocoa powder** (like Hershey’s or Guittard) for best flavor. *Avoid* \"chocolate chips\" here—they’ll make the cake too dense.  \\n> - **Buttermilk** = key for tender texture. If you only have milk, use 1 cup milk + 1 tsp vinegar (let sit 5 mins).\\n\\n#### 🧾 Step-by-Step Instructions\\n1. **Preheat oven** to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan or line with parchment paper.  \\n2. **Mix dry ingredients**: In a bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.  \\n3. **Add wet ingredients**: In another bowl, mix buttermilk, oil, eggs, and vanilla. Pour into dry ingredients.  \\n4. **Combine gently**: Stir *just until no dry spots* (overmixing = tough cake). Don’t overwork!  \\n5. **Bake**: Pour into pan. Bake 25–30 mins (or until a toothpick comes out clean).  \\n6. **Cool**: Let cool 10 mins in pan, then transfer to a wire rack. *Do not skip cooling*—it prevents a soggy cake!  \\n\\n#### 🎁 Optional Chocolate Frosting (10 mins)\\nFor a rich finish, mix:  \\n- ½ cup melted chocolate (use 70% dark chocolate for best flavor)  \\n- 2 tbsp heavy cream  \\n- 1 tbsp sugar  \\nWhisk until smooth. Drizzle over cake while still warm.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 🔑 Key Tips for Success\\n| **Common Mistake**       | **Fix It**                                  |\\n|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\\n| Cake is dry               | Use buttermilk (not milk) + don’t overbake  |\\n| Bitter taste              | Use high-quality cocoa powder (no sugar added) |\\n| Cracks on top             | Don’t overmix—stop when no dry bits remain  |\\n| Too dense                 | Add 1 tbsp oil if the batter is too thick   |\\n\\n> ✅ **Why this recipe shines**:  \\n> - **No sugar in cocoa** = avoids artificial sweetness.  \\n> - **Buttermilk** = tender texture (baking powder alone makes cake tough).  \\n> - **Minimal steps** = perfect for busy days or first-time bakers.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis cake is **so good** that I’ve made it 100+ times!
