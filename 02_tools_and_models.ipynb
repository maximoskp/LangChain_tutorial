      "As of **July 2024**, the **de facto leader of Venezuela is Nicolás Maduro**, who has been the President since **2013**. However, the situation is highly contested due to the **political crisis and ongoing conflict** between Maduro's government and the opposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Details:\n",
      "1. **Official Status**:  \n",
      "   - Maduro was **elected in 2013** and re-elected in **2018** (though the 2018 election was widely disputed).  \n",
      "   - In **2023**, he won a controversial presidential election, which the opposition and many international observers deemed fraudulent.  \n",
      "   - The **National Assembly** (controlled by Maduro's allies) declared a **\"state of emergency\"** in May 2023, suspending the presidency and forcing Maduro to step down temporarily. However, he **was re-elected in a disputed vote** later that year, and the National Assembly reinstated him.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **International Recognition**:  \n",
      "   - **United Nations, Brazil, Colombia, and other countries** recognize Maduro as the legitimate president.  \n",
      "   - **The United States, Canada, the EU, and many Latin American nations** do not recognize his 2023 election, calling it a \"sham\" and supporting the opposition's claim of a \"state of emergency.\"  \n",
      "   - The **Venezuelan government** maintains Maduro is the rightful leader, while the **opposition (led by Juan Guaidó)** claims the 2023 election was invalid and that the presidency should be contested.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Current Situation**:  \n",
      "   - Venezuela has been in a **prolonged political and economic crisis** since 2014, with severe shortages of food, medicine, and electricity.  \n",
      "   - Maduro's government has **tightened control** over institutions, while the opposition has held protests and sought international support.  \n",
      "   - In **April 2024**, the National Assembly **rejected Maduro's legitimacy**, but the Supreme Court later ruled he could stay in power until 2028.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### Why the Confusion?  \n",
      "- **Legitimacy**: Maduro's government claims he was elected by the Venezuelan people, but the opposition argues the 2023 election was rigged.  \n",
      "- **Legal Ambiguity**: The National Assembly's actions in 2023 created a power vacuum, leading to the **2023 \"state of emergency\"** that suspended Maduro's presidency. However, he **was restored as president** after the National Assembly declared him the legitimate leader.  \n",
      "- **International Context**: The U.S. and allies have **not recognized** Maduro's 2023 victory, while the UN and many countries **do**.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:  \n",
      "While **Nicolás Maduro** is the **officially recognized President of Venezuela** by the government and the UN, his position is **contested internationally** and marked by **ongoing civil unrest**. The situation remains fluid, with no clear resolution as of **July 2024**. For the most current updates, it's best to consult **Venezuelan government sources** or **reputable news outlets like Reuters or BBC**.  \n",

      "Cassowaries (Indonesian: kasuari; Biak: man suar 'bird strong'; Tok Pisin: muruk; Papuan: kasu weri 'horned head') are flightless birds of the genus Casuarius, in the order Casuariiformes. They are classified as ratites, flightless birds without a keel on their sternum bones. Cassowaries are native to the tropical forests of New Guinea (Western New Guinea and Papua New Guinea), the Moluccas (Seram and Aru Islands), and northeastern Australia.\n",
      "Three cassowary species are extant. The most common, the southern cassowary, is the third-tallest and second-heaviest living bird, smaller only than the ostrich and emu. The other two species are the northern cassowary and the dwarf cassowary; the northern cassowary is the most recently discovered and the most threatened. A fourth, extinct, species is the pygmy cassowary.\n",
      "Cassowaries are very wary of humans, but if provoked, they are capable of inflicting serious, even fatal, injuries. They are known to attack both dogs and people. The cassowary has often been labelled \"the world's most dangerous bird\", although in terms of recorded statistics, it pales in comparison to the common ostrich, which kills two to three humans per year in South Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Taxonomy, systematics, and evolution ==\n",
      "The genus Casuarius was erected by French scientist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in his Ornithologie published in 1760. The type species is the southern cassowary (Casuarius casuarius). The Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus had introduced the genus Casuarius in the sixth edition of his Systema Naturae published in 1748, but Linnaeus dropped the genus in the important tenth edition of 1758 and put the southern cassowary together with the common ostrich and the greater rhea in the genus Struthio. As the publication date of Linnaeus's sixth edition was before the 1758 starting point of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, Brisson, and not Linnaeus, is considered the authority for the genus.\n",
      "Cassowaries (from Malay: kasuari cognate of several related languages spoken around the Moluccas and New Guinea) are part of the ratite group, which also includes the emu, rheas, ostriches, and kiwi, as well as the extinct moas and elephant birds. These species are recognised:\n",
      "\n",
      "Most authorities consider the taxonomic classification above to be monotypic, but several subspecies of each have been described, and some of them have even been suggested as separate species, e.g., C. (b) papuanus. The taxonomic name C. (b) papuanus also may be in need of revision to Casuarius (bennetti) westermanni. Validation of these subspecies has proven difficult due to individual variations, age-related variations, the scarcity of specimens, the stability of specimens (the bright skin of the head and neck—the basis of describing several subspecies—fades in specimens), and the practice of trading live cassowaries for thousands of years, some of which are likely to have escaped or been deliberately introduced to regions away from their origin.\n",
      "The evolutionary history of cassowaries, as of all ratites, is not well known. Genetic evidence suggests that their closest living relatives are emus, and that the dwarf cassowary is more closely related to the Northern Cassowary than either is to the Southern cassowary. A fossil species was reported from Australia, but for reasons of biogeography, this assignment is not certain, and it might belong to the prehistoric Emuarius, which was a genus of cassowary-like primitive emus.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Description ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Typically, all cassowaries are shy birds that are found in the deep forest. They are adept at disappearing long before a human knows they are there. The southern cassowary of the far north Queensland rain forests is not well studied, and the northern and dwarf cassowaries even less so. Females are larger and more brightly coloured than the males. Adult southern cassowaries are 1.5 to 1.8 m (4 ft 11 in to 5 ft 11 in) tall, although some females may reach 2 m (6 ft 6+1⁄2 in), and weigh 58.5 kg\n"

    "### Different results\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the randomness expressed by temperature, the model may go through different routes in answering the question. Below you can some indicative instances where the model was able to produce a proper query (asking about the number of kasawari spieces), get a proper answer and come up with a proper response. Here are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Used the `wikipedia_search` tool with a general query (\"Kasawari\") but got right results:\n",
    "```\n",
    "{'name': 'wikipedia_search', 'args': {'query': 'Kasawari'}, 'id': '18f1325f-db46-49d9-a337-6c3d26acfa8d', 'type': 'tool_call'}\n",
    "There are three species of cassowaries, which are also known as \"Kasawari\" in Indonesian. The family Casuariidae includes these three species:  \n",
    "1. Southern cassowary (*Casuarius casuarius*)  \n",
    "2. Northern cassowary (*Casuarius unappendiculatus*)  \n",
    "3. Dwarf cassowary (*Casuarius bennetti*)  \n",
    "\n",
    "While the tool response mentions \"four surviving members\" (including the emu), the emu belongs to a different family (Dromaiidae) and is not part of the cassowary group. Thus, the correct count of *Kasawari* (cassowary) species is **three**.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Used the `search` tool with a general search term (\"Kasawari\") and got wrong results:\n",
    "```\n",
    "{'name': 'search', 'args': {'query': 'Kasawari'}, 'id': 'd6043885-5bab-474d-b30f-c85d7b1684dc', 'type': 'tool_call'}\n",
    "Based on the provided search results, there is no specific information about the number of species of \"Kasawari\" (which appears to be a common name for a song, street, or cultural reference rather than a biological species). The search results do not mention any taxonomic classification, scientific species count, or biological context for \"Kasawari.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if \"Kasawari\" refers to the **Spotted Dove** (*Columba palumbus*), a bird species known by this name in some regions (e.g., the Philippines), it is a **single species**. But since the search results do not confirm this biological context, the answer cannot be definitively derived from the given data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**: The search results do not provide information about the number of *species* of \"Kasawari.\" If this term refers to a biological entity, further clarification or a scientific database would be needed.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Used the `search` tool with a more specific search term (\"how many species of Kasawari are there\") and got correct results:\n",
    "```\n",
    "{'name': 'search', 'args': {'query': 'how many species of Kasawari are there'}, 'id': '11f93411-6230-411a-97ae-77fe481bd994', 'type': 'tool_call'}\n",
    "There are three species of cassowaries, which are commonly referred to as Kasawari. The tool response confirms that \"all three species of cassowaries are considered as Asia's largest bird since the extinction of the Arabian ostrich.\" Thus, the number of species is **three**.\n",
