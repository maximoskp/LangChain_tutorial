      "As of my latest update (October 2023), **Nicolás Maduro** is the **President of Venezuela**, holding the office since 2013. Here's a clear breakdown of the situation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Current Status:**\n",
      "    *   Maduro was first elected President in 2013, following a controversial election. He was re-elected in 2018 and again in 2023.\n",
      "    *   He is the **officially recognized President** by the Venezuelan government and the constitution of Venezuela.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Context & Controversy:**\n",
      "    *   **Disputed Elections:** Maduro's 2013 and 2018 elections were widely disputed by opposition groups, international observers, and many foreign governments (including the U.S., EU, and Latin American nations). The opposition, led by Juan Guaidó, declared Maduro's victory invalid in 2014 and 2018, claiming he was a \"dictator\" and that the elections were \"null and void.\"\n",
      "    *   **International Recognition:** While Maduro's government claims legitimacy, **the majority of the international community does not recognize him as the legitimate president.** The U.S., the European Union, and most Latin American countries (including Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico) recognize the **National Assembly** (which declared itself the \"National Constituent Assembly\") as the legitimate body, but this has been rejected by Maduro's government.\n",
      "    *   **Constitutional Changes:** In 2019, the Venezuelan National Assembly passed a constitutional amendment allowing Maduro to run for a third term. He won the 2023 election with 79% of the vote, but the legitimacy of this election is also disputed.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Why the Confusion?**\n",
      "    *   **Juan Guaidó's Claim:** In 2019, opposition leader Juan Guaidó declared himself the \"Acting President\" of Venezuela, claiming Maduro had violated the constitution. His claim was recognized by the U.S. and many other countries, but it was rejected by Maduro's government. Guaidó's claim was later recognized by the U.S. in 2023, but his government has been declared illegal by Maduro's government.\n",
      "    *   **The 2023 Election:** Maduro won the 2023 presidential election, but the election was widely criticized as unfair. The U.S. and others condemned it, but Maduro's government claims it was valid.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary:**\n",
      "*   **Officially (Venezuelan Government):** **Nicolás Maduro** is the President of Venezuela.\n",
      "*   **Internationally:** Many countries do **not recognize** Maduro as the legitimate president. They recognize the **National Assembly** (which declared itself the \"National Constituent Assembly\") as the legitimate body, but this has been rejected by Maduro's government.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Therefore, the answer to \"Who is the President of Venezuela?\" is Nicolás Maduro, as he is the current head of state recognized by the Venezuelan government.** However, it's crucial to understand the significant controversy and lack of international recognition surrounding his position.\n"

    "### Results without tool\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of writing this tutorial (January 2026) the model was trained with data up to July 2024 and the answer it gave was the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "As of **July 2024**, the **de facto leader of Venezuela is Nicolás Maduro**, who has been the President since **2013**. However, the situation is highly contested due to the **political crisis and ongoing conflict** between Maduro's government and the opposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Details:\n",
    "1. **Official Status**:  \n",
    "   - Maduro was **elected in 2013** and re-elected in **2018** (though the 2018 election was widely disputed).  \n",
    "   - In **2023**, he won a controversial presidential election, which the opposition and many international observers deemed fraudulent.  \n",
    "   - The **National Assembly** (controlled by Maduro's allies) declared a **\"state of emergency\"** in May 2023, suspending the presidency and forcing Maduro to step down temporarily. However, he **was re-elected in a disputed vote** later that year, and the National Assembly reinstated him.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **International Recognition**:  \n",
    "   - **United Nations, Brazil, Colombia, and other countries** recognize Maduro as the legitimate president.  \n",
    "   - **The United States, Canada, the EU, and many Latin American nations** do not recognize his 2023 election, calling it a \"sham\" and supporting the opposition's claim of a \"state of emergency.\"  \n",
    "   - The **Venezuelan government** maintains Maduro is the rightful leader, while the **opposition (led by Juan Guaidó)** claims the 2023 election was invalid and that the presidency should be contested.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Current Situation**:  \n",
    "   - Venezuela has been in a **prolonged political and economic crisis** since 2014, with severe shortages of food, medicine, and electricity.  \n",
    "   - Maduro's government has **tightened control** over institutions, while the opposition has held protests and sought international support.  \n",
    "   - In **April 2024**, the National Assembly **rejected Maduro's legitimacy**, but the Supreme Court later ruled he could stay in power until 2028.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why the Confusion?  \n",
    "- **Legitimacy**: Maduro's government claims he was elected by the Venezuelan people, but the opposition argues the 2023 election was rigged.  \n",
    "- **Legal Ambiguity**: The National Assembly's actions in 2023 created a power vacuum, leading to the **2023 \"state of emergency\"** that suspended Maduro's presidency. However, he **was restored as president** after the National Assembly declared him the legitimate leader.  \n",
    "- **International Context**: The U.S. and allies have **not recognized** Maduro's 2023 victory, while the UN and many countries **do**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:  \n",
    "While **Nicolás Maduro** is the **officially recognized President of Venezuela** by the government and the UN, his position is **contested internationally** and marked by **ongoing civil unrest**. The situation remains fluid, with no clear resolution as of **July 2024**. For the most current updates, it's best to consult **Venezuelan government sources** or **reputable news outlets like Reuters or BBC**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: This answer reflects the status as of July 2024. Political developments can change rapidly.*\n",

      "Cassowaries (Indonesian: kasuari; Biak: man suar 'bird strong'; Tok Pisin: muruk; Papuan: kasu weri 'horned head') are flightless birds of the genus Casuarius, in the order Casuariiformes. They are classified as ratites, flightless birds without a keel on their sternum bones. Cassowaries are native to the tropical forests of New Guinea (Western New Guinea and Papua New Guinea), the Moluccas (Seram and Aru Islands), and northeastern Australia.\n",
      "Three cassowary species are extant. The most common, the southern cassowary, is the third-tallest and second-heaviest living bird, smaller only than the ostrich and emu. The other two species are the northern cassowary and the dwarf cassowary; the northern cassowary is the most recently discovered and the most threatened. A fourth, extinct, species is the pygmy cassowary.\n",
      "Cassowaries are very wary of humans, but if provoked, they are capable of inflicting serious, even fatal, injuries. They are known to attack both dogs and people. The cassowary has often been labelled \"the world's most dangerous bird\", although in terms of recorded statistics, it pales in comparison to the common ostrich, which kills two to three humans per year in South Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Taxonomy, systematics, and evolution ==\n",
      "The genus Casuarius was erected by French scientist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in his Ornithologie published in 1760. The type species is the southern cassowary (Casuarius casuarius). The Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus had introduced the genus Casuarius in the sixth edition of his Systema Naturae published in 1748, but Linnaeus dropped the genus in the important tenth edition of 1758 and put the southern cassowary together with the common ostrich and the greater rhea in the genus Struthio. As the publication date of Linnaeus's sixth edition was before the 1758 starting point of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, Brisson, and not Linnaeus, is considered the authority for the genus.\n",
      "Cassowaries (from Malay: kasuari cognate of several related languages spoken around the Moluccas and New Guinea) are part of the ratite group, which also includes the emu, rheas, ostriches, and kiwi, as well as the extinct moas and elephant birds. These species are recognised:\n",
      "\n",
      "Most authorities consider the taxonomic classification above to be monotypic, but several subspecies of each have been described, and some of them have even been suggested as separate species, e.g., C. (b) papuanus. The taxonomic name C. (b) papuanus also may be in need of revision to Casuarius (bennetti) westermanni. Validation of these subspecies has proven difficult due to individual variations, age-related variations, the scarcity of specimens, the stability of specimens (the bright skin of the head and neck—the basis of describing several subspecies—fades in specimens), and the practice of trading live cassowaries for thousands of years, some of which are likely to have escaped or been deliberately introduced to regions away from their origin.\n",
      "The evolutionary history of cassowaries, as of all ratites, is not well known. Genetic evidence suggests that their closest living relatives are emus, and that the dwarf cassowary is more closely related to the Northern Cassowary than either is to the Southern cassowary. A fossil species was reported from Australia, but for reasons of biogeography, this assignment is not certain, and it might belong to the prehistoric Emuarius, which was a genus of cassowary-like primitive emus.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Description ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Typically, all cassowaries are shy birds that are found in the deep forest. They are adept at disappearing long before a human knows they are there. The southern cassowary of the far north Queensland rain forests is not well studied, and the northern and dwarf cassowaries even less so. Females are larger and more brightly coloured than the males. Adult southern cassowaries are 1.5 to 1.8 m (4 ft 11 in to 5 ft 11 in) tall, although some females may reach 2 m (6 ft 6+1⁄2 in), and weigh 58.5 kg\n"
